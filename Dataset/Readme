USAGE

    1) Create in "Dataset" directory a folder with the name of dataset to analize <datasetName>
     and add two directory "Input" and "Output":

    2) Put in folder the text files:
        - Weighted Graph -> weigthedGraph.txt
        - Unweighted Graph -> unweightedGraph.txt
        - Similarity relationship file among dual networks nodes -> similarityFile.txt
    3) In Main.py
        - Modify datesetNameFolder with the name of the folder containing the dataset to be analyzed;
    4) Run Main.py

DATESET 

    1) DBLP: 
        A dual network representing authors and the similarity of the activity of their research.

    2) GOWALLA:
        GoWalla is a social network where users share their locations (expressed as GPS coordinates) 
        by checking-in into the web-site.
